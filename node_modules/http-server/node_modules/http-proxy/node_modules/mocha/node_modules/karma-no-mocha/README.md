# karma-no-mocha

> karma-mocha without the peer dependency of mocha

**You probably don't want this package; install [karma-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-mocha) instead.**

This is [karma-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-mocha), slightly tweaked to test [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) itself.
